            <h3>Awards & Nominations</h3>
            <p>English singer, songwriter, and actor Harry Styles has received 33 awards and 100 nominations. For his work on his debut studio album Harry Styles (2017) he received a Brit Award and an ARIA Award. He made his film debut in Christopher Nolan's war film, Dunkirk (2017), for which he received two acting ensemble nominations at the Critics' Choice Movie Awards and the Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association Awards alongside the rest of the cast.
                <h4>Treat People With Kindness</h4>
                <p>"Treat People with Kindness", also abbreviated to "TPWK", is a slogan used by Styles to promote his message of love, acceptance and kindness to people. Styles started using the slogan on his debut concert tour in 2017, on a badge on his guitar and on tour merchandise, including Pride t-shirts sold to raise funds for GLSEN. In an interview in December 2019 he said, "It was a pin I had on my guitar strap and we made t-shirts for it, then I saw a lot of t-shirts around. I'd be driving or something and see someone in one and I started feeling like, 'Oh this is a bit of a thing'". This gave Styles the idea of writing a song to go with the slogan titled "Treat People with Kindness", which is the penultimate track on his second studio album, Fine Line.<br><br>
                    
                    In October 2019, teaser posters including the phrase "Do you know who you are?" and the acronym "TPWK" were spotted in London, Tokyo, Los Angeles, New York and Australia, which fans were able to connect to Styles and his new album release due to the reference to his "Treat People with Kindness" motto. At the same time to mark World Mental Health Day, Styles launched a website bot called "Do You Know Who You Are?" that gives users positive randomised messages using words such as bright, determined, loving and wonderful, and ending with "TPWK. LOVE, H". </p>
